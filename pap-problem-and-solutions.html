                    <p>Older machines tend to produce a humming or vibratory sound. If you have an old machine, keep it as far away from you as possible or you can try using an earplug or noise canceling headphones. Fortunately, most new models of PAP devices are almost silent and you may opt to get an upgrade instead.</p>
                    <p>Note:</p>
                    <p>&#9679; Check with your DME provider if you’re eligible for a new machine. Typically, insurance covers for a new one every 5 years or if your current machine is broken beyond repair.</p>

                    <p>Some patients, especially those with high pressure settings, have difficulty tolerating the pressure and this can be quite the hurdle.</p>
                    <p>&#9679; Turn on the ramp feature. This allows you to start with a low pressure setting which is followed by a gradual increase until the recommended pressure setting is reached.</p>
                    <p>&#9679; Turn the C-Flex/A-Flex/BIFLEX (Respironics) or EPR (ResMed) on which allows the pressure to decrease slightly upon exhalation.</p>

                    <p>It may take some time to get used to sleeping with your PAP machine. The more you use your CPAP, the easier it becomes.</p>

                    <p>&#9679; Practice good sleep hygiene.</p>
                    <p>&#9679; Try to use the PAP during the day while sitting on a chair or sofa while reading or watching TV to get used to the sensation of PAP.</p>

                    <p>If this is a common problem for you, try a hose management system. These are designed to keep your hose away out of arm’s reach, so you won’t find yourself waking up in a tangled web of hose.</p>
                    <p>&#9679; You may want to use a ‘Top of the head’ mask. The tubing connects to the mask from a connection point that sits on top of the head as opposed to traditional CPAP masks that connect to the front of the mask.</p>
                    <p>&#9679; Try hanging your tubing from your head board/bed head.</p>
                    <p>&#9679; Try to use a CPAP pillow. Specifically designed with CPAP users providing space for your CPAP tubing to rest.</p>

                    <p>The length of a standard CPAP tubing is about 6 feet. Active sleepers who toss and turn are more apt to tug on the tubing and pull their machine off the bedside table. Most CPAP suppliers offer tubing in 10 feet lengths which give patients more freedom of movement.</p>

                    <p>When the temperature drops in the fall and winter, many patients experience water condensation in their tubing and masks. When the air blows through the wet tubing, it creates a loud gurgling sound.</p>
                    <p>&#9679; Lower the humidity setting on your humidifier.</p>
                    <p>&#9679; Insulate the tubing with a hose wrap or keep it underneath the covers.</p>

                  <div class="content">
                    <p>Aerophagia occurs when the air delivered by the CPAP enters the esophagus and stomach rather than the lungs. This can lead to painful stomach bloating, gas and belching.</p>
                    <p>Possible Causes:</p>
                    <p>&#9679; The CPAP pressure may be higher than you require.</p>
                    <p>&#9679; The CPAP pressure may be too low and inadequate to resolve the apnea event and in your effort to get more air into the lungs, you gulp air in quickly.</p>
                    <p>&#9679; You may have nasal congestion from a cold, flu or allergies. When your nose is stuffy, you may not be able to receive the CPAP pressure you need so you gulp air by mouth.</p>
                    <p>&#9679; You may be a mouth breather. As your mouth falls open during sleep, air intended to enter the lungs may escape via the mouth. This may cause apnea events to not be resolved resulting to choking sensations and gulping air in quickly.</p>
                    <p>&#9679; You may have difficulty exhaling against the pressure. This may cause anxiety, panic and a feeling of choking which may cause you to hyperventilate. This can result in quick gulping of air.</p>
                    <p>Solutions:</p>
                    <p>&#9679; Adjust the pressure setting.</p>
                    <p>&#9679; Switch to a full face mask if you’re a mouth breather or use a chin strap.</p>
                    <p>&#9679; Turn the C-Flex/A-Flex/BIFLEX (Respironics) or EPR (ResMed) on which allows the pressure to decrease slightly upon exhalation.</p>

                    <p>The air released by the CPAP machine is generally cool and very dry which can cause nasal dryness, irritation and congestion.</p>
                    <p>&#9679; The best method to alleviate this discomfort is turning the heated humidifier on and adjust the setting as needed. This will add moisture and reduce nasal symptoms.</p>

                    <p>It is not uncommon to feel anxious or claustrophobic when wearing a CPAP mask. Getting used to wearing a CPAP mask takes time and requires patience as you adjust to the therapy.</p>
                    <p>&#x31;. Practice wearing your mask while you’re awake. Without any of the others parts attached, hold the mask up your face. Once you’re comfortable with that, try wearing the mask with the straps. Take small steps to get used to the mask.</p>
                    <p>&#x32;. Next, try holding the mask with the hose connected but without using the straps. Turn the machine on at the lowest pressure setting.</p>
                    <p>&#x33;. Finally, wear the mask with the straps and with the air pressure turned on while awake. After you’re comfortable with that, try sleeping with it on.</p>
                    <p>Helpful Tips:</p>
                    <p>&#9679; Try relaxation exercises to help reduce your anxiety about wearing your CPAP mask.</p>
                    <p>&#9679; Use it while you’re watching TV or reading a book to help you get used to the feeling of not only the mask but also the sensation of the air pressure.</p>
                    <p>&#9679; It may help to get a different mask style such as a nasal pillow which has minimal contact with the skin.</p>

                    <p>If you travel a lot and find lugging your CPAP machine around to be inconvenient, consider purchasing a travel CPAP. They’re specifically designed to be lightweight and portable, easing all of your travel concerns.</p>
                    <p>Note:</p>
                    <p>&#9679; Travel PAPs are not covered by insurance.</p>

                    <p>Many new CPAP users may experience vivid dreaming or nightmares during the start of their CPAP therapy. This is an indication of increased REM sleep and is a positive sign that your sleep apnea is being treated. Excessive dreaming and nightmares are usually short-lived and will subside.</p>

                  <div class="content">
                    <p>CPAP compliance measures how many hours and nights you use your therapy. Most insurances require that you use your machine at least 4 hours a night for at least 70% of the nights.</p>
                    <p>&#9679; Any day that you don’t use the machine affects compliance, that’s how it’s calculated.</p>
